          Hi! Thank you so much for checking out my portfolio! My name is Nico,
          I'm a student from the Netherlands with a big passion for coding and
          web design. I started this portfolio to show off my work and to keep
          myself motivated to continue coding. Currently I'm working on both
          front-end (mostly JavaScript) and back-end (mostly Node.js)
          development.
